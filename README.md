# Module_5-challenge
This project analyzes the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume under the Capomulin drug regimen. The dataset is filtered to include only Capomulin-treated mice, and the data is grouped by Mouse ID to calculate average tumor volumes and weights. A linear regression model is applied to explore the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, and the results are visualized with a scatter plot and regression line. The correlation coefficient (RÂ² value) is calculated and displayed on the plot, offering insights into the strength of the relationship between the two variables.
